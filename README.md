# CowsBulls
Digital version of game "Bulls Cows"

Rules of game:
In the classic version of the game is designed for two players. Each of the players conceives and records a secret 4-digit number with non-recurring numbers [1]. The player who starts the game by lot, makes the first attempt to guess the number. Attempt is a 4-digit number with non-recurring digits reported to the opponent. The enemy reports in response how many numbers are guessed without coinciding with their positions in a secret number (that is, the number of cows) and how many are guessed right up to a position in a secret number (that is, the number of bulls). 
For example: Conceived secret number "3219". Attempt: "2310". Result: two “cows” (two numbers: “2” and “3” - guessed in the wrong positions) and one “bull” (one number “1” was guessed right up to the position).
Players make attempts to guess by turns. The winner is the one who guesses the number first, provided that he did not start 
the game. If the guesser started the game, his opponent is given the last chance to guess the sequence.
When playing against the computer, the player enters combinations one by one, until the entire sequence is guessed.
